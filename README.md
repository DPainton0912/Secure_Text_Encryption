# Secure-Text-Encryption
This project is a console application that can read a text file that is specified by the user and encrypts it to a new file specified by the user, and read a text file that is specified by the user and decrypt it to a new file specified by the user. It uses one of two methods, the Caesar cipher or Polyalphabetic cipher (Vigen√®re cipher).

# Features include:
- Encrypt data using Caesar cipher.
- Decrypt data using Caesar cipher.
- Encrypt data using Polyalphabetic cipher.
- Decrypt data using Polyalphabetic cipher.
# Getting started:
- Start application
- Input a file name with text, you can add the text file extension but don't have to as the application will add it automatically.
- Input if encrypting or decrypting and what method you wish to use.
- Input a shift, which will be a number if using Caesar cipher or a key, which will be either a word or random collection of characters if using Polyalphabetic cipher.
- The application will then encrypt/decrypt the text from the file.
- Input a filename for the encrypted/decrypted text, if you don't want to overwrite the original file use a completely different file name as the application not case sensitive.
- Refer to the new file to see encrypted/decrypted text.
